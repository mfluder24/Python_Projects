### Nice Or Mean Game
A simple text-based game in Python. It responds to user input, and utilises the Playsound module.

### Phonebook Application
A basic project that functions as a virutal phone book for the user. It stores a contact's name, phnoe number, and email address in a database, and allows the user to update and delete existing entries. 

### File Transfer Application
This project utilises tkinter to make a GUI for the user to transfer recently added/updated .txt files from one chosen directory to another. All files moved are stored in a database.
